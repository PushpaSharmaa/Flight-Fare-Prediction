Flight Fare Prediction


📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting flight ticket prices based on various travel details such as airline, source, destination, total stops, and departure/arrival times. The aim is to build a machine learning model that helps travelers and businesses estimate flight prices more accurately.
